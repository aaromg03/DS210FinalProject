# DS210FinalProject
* In this project, I imported two txt files: a Facebook one and an Emron one.
* I placed them into an empty graph and added nodes and edges
* I then implemented the Dijkstra algorithm so that I can find the shortest path between the nodes
* Once I did that, I found the average distance
* I did this for both and I compared the distances
* Programming language: Rust
* Contributors: **ChatGPT**  for helping me with debugging the code(lines 28-30 and line 62)
